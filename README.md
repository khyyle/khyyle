## hey! ðŸ‘‹
I like building scalable models that recover signal from messy data. Iâ€™m particularly interested in:

- inverse problems and imaging (NeRF architectures)
- ML for time-series
- large language models
- uncertainty & regularization
- quantitative finance--factors, risk decomposition, robust decision rules
